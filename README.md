# Airline Quality Ratings

This is my final project for STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This project was completed in June 2024 in collaboration with three other students. We analyzed the [Airline Quality Ratings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/airline-quality-ratings) in order to investigate trends in airline passengers' demographics, travel classes, and satisfaction levels.
